  As an artist I approach my work as a visual continuum of thought and energy.I
  actively mold my intentions through the consideration of various perspectives
  and experimentation of ideas.At the basis of my current work is integrating my
  philosophy of consciousness and the vitality of curiousness that I practice to
  find beauty and obscurity in the questions I ask.At the basis of art I believe
  are more questions waiting to be unearthed as one opens their intentions to
  interpretation.The energy I gather from my life experience transforms into the
  visceral energy that guides my hand on the canvas.

As an artist I approach my work as a visual continuum of thought and energy.I actively mold my intentions through the consideration of various perspectives and experimentation of ideas.At the basis of my current work is integrating my philosophy of consciousness and the vitality of curiousness that I practice to find beauty and obscurity in the questions I ask.At the basis of art I believe are more questions waiting to be unearthed as one opens their intentions to interpretation.The energy I gather from my life experience transforms into the visceral energy that guides my hand on the canvas.

I typically observe technology from a curious eye: awaiting to see the possibilities while questioning its essence and future implications.One particular observance is the romantic void.I hope to resurrect this void through my art hoping to apply a sense of soul and humanity to the age of modernity.I aim to balance the futuristic notion of technology, that is fast-moving, static, sleek, neutral, cool, rigid, quantifiable, calculated, with the concept of romance that is warm, lucid, soft, mysterious, sensual, unpredictable, and beautiful.To stabilize these contrasting qualities is the visual element of perceived energy that is stable, reliable, frisky, empowering, transformative, intuitive, and subliminal.These various undertones aim to achieve such a state of ambivalence in which one may hear hip-hop and classical music emulating simultaneously. 

I hope to inspire intuition and feeling in an age overwhelmed with the drive for reason and logic--so that those may look inward and backwards to the past to question the future, but never to forsake the present.

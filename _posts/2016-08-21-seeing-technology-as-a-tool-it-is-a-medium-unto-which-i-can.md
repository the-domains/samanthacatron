  Seeing technology as a tool. It is a medium unto which I can share information
  and express myself. The content I put out is not for everyone it is simply for
  those drawn to it-those who will appreciate it by virtue of their own calling.
  I am relinquishing my fear of unacceptance. No such thing should exist. I am
  wholly complete and if I am to be my true authentic self then 'acceptance' is
  to come from within and not from those external to my own being. My art has
  allowed me to accomplish this. What I put onto the canvas is driven only my
  true instinct and intuition. My creativity is channeled from me to the paint.
  This is what I understand to be the meaning in my life. I must take the next
  step and acknowledge the purpose in my life as well, which is to give it
  away-to share it with the world. The art of exchange in which I am fully
  acceptive of my own talent and capability and make the choice to exchange it
  for greater levels of being. Unattachment to my art is what fulfills the
  universality of all existence. This is the energy force of the cosmos. I do
  not own my talent. I do not own anything. It is in my possession, but that can
  create stagnant energy overtime. Understanding that such energy can be
  alchemized and transformed into something different-more dynamic, more
  creative. In this equation, money is useful in which it is a catalyst. Money
  creates movement. Money is energy, and if used productively can fuel my
  endeavors towards greater creativity. Understanding this brings me peace as I
  approach acting upon the purpose behind my art. It is creation, it is energy,
  it should have movement, it should not be stagnant, it is meant to be shared.
  The universe is full of gifts. Gifts of creation and being. They should not
  all be the same, nor should they be contained. Gifts that are contained and
  hidden are denied vitality. Their energy is denied flourishment. A world full
  of gifts is a world of gifts that belong to all existence within the world
  itself. One being should not judge another, but be receptive. Those that find
  greater appreciation appealing to their own interests will partake in
  communication, collaboration, and acceleration of such ideas. Acceptance is
  this sort of appreciation and it should not be reduced down to a universal
  standard. Vitality and diversity brings joy and talent should just as so bring
  joy. We are all different with different talents that are meant to be shared.
  In the words of Pablo Picasso, “The meaning of life is to find your gift. The
  purpose of life is to give it away.”

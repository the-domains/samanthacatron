            <description><![CDATA[<p>Seeing technology as a tool. It is a medium unto which I can share information and express myself. The content I put out is not for everyone it is simply for those drawn to it-those who will appreciate it by virtue of their own calling. I am relinquishing my fear of unacceptance. No such thing should exist. I am wholly complete and if I am to be my true authentic self then 'acceptance' is to come from within and not from those external to my own being. My art has allowed me to accomplish this. What I put onto the canvas is driven only my true instinct and intuition. My creativity is channeled from me to the paint. This is what I understand to be the meaning in my life. I must take the next step and acknowledge the purpose in my life as well, which is to give it away-to share it with the world. The art of exchange in which I am fully acceptive of my own talent and capability and make the choice to exchange it for greater levels of being. Unattachment to my art is what fulfills the universality of all existence. This is the energy force of the cosmos. I do not own my talent. I do not own anything. It is in my possession, but that can create stagnant energy overtime. Understanding that such energy can be alchemized and transformed into something different-more dynamic, more creative. In this equation, money is useful in which it is a catalyst. Money creates movement. Money is energy, and if used productively can fuel my endeavors towards greater creativity. Understanding this brings me peace as I approach acting upon the purpose behind my art. It is creation, it is energy, it should have movement, it should not be stagnant, it is meant to be shared. The universe is full of gifts. Gifts of creation and being. They should not all be the same, nor should they be contained. Gifts that are contained and hidden are denied vitality. Their energy is denied flourishment. A world full of gifts is a world of gifts that belong to all existence within the world itself. One being should not judge another, but be receptive. Those that find greater appreciation appealing to their own interests will partake in communication, collaboration, and acceleration of such ideas. Acceptance is this sort of appreciation and it should not be reduced down to a universal standard. Vitality and diversity brings joy and talent should just as so bring joy. We are all different with different talents that are meant to be shared. In the words of Pablo Picasso, “The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.”</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>As an artist I approach my work as a visual continuum of thought and energy.I actively mold my intentions through the consideration of various perspectives and experimentation of ideas.At the basis of my current work is integrating my philosophy of consciousness and the vitality of curiousness that I practice to find beauty and obscurity in the questions I ask.At the basis of art I believe are more questions waiting to be unearthed as one opens their intentions to interpretation.The energy I gather from my life experience transforms into the visceral energy that guides my hand on the canvas.</p>]]></description>
